Software Description:
The delivered software will start by allocating memory according to the following function.
  f(0)=2700 & f(n+1)=2*f(n), where n is an index of the integer array for 0< n < 20.
Where f(n) will indicate the size of an array of char pointers at n.
After the memory is allocated the memory is assigned to random upper case letters.
Then a main menu is accessible. Upon pressing 1, the user is prompted an index from 0 to 19.
Upon pressing an index, it will bring up a sub menu which allows the user to view the first 10 
chars in the index upon pressing 1 or deleted the chars at the index upon pressing 2.
Upon pressing 2 in the main menu, the indexes of de-allocated indexes will be listed.
Upon pressing 3 in the main menu, all of the indexes for all the char pointers will be deleted.
Upon pressing 4 in the main menu, any remaining indexes will be deleted and the program will exit cleanly.

Critique:
Initialization takes a long amount of time (almost 10 minutes). Re-allocating the index number 19 will also take a long time.Other than that, program runs to specification exactly.
