Software Description:
The following software delivered will bring up a UI which will prompt
the user for 2 strings. The first prompt is the string being replaced
and the second prompt will be the string that will replace the first one.
Using a pre-loaded document, the software will take in the strings 
and fork into a child process which will count how many replacements
will occur and it will replace those strings. The child will utilize
a block of shared memory to pass the change document back to the parent.
A bug was introduced that will infinitely loop the child's attempt to
replace the string and follow the attempt with a printing of the '.'
character. Once the child is finished or closed remotely the 
parent will re-prompt the user with further string replacements until !wq
is entered. Once !wq is entered the software deletes the block of shared 
memory and the software the closes.

Critique:
No critques. The software performs as delivered. The software requires 8192 bytes of memory open
and the process table to still be open to creating a process. If either of these are absent
it will cause a failure due to no resources for the software to allocate and close without
causing bugs. This software requires Testdoc.txt to be in the same directory as the executable.
